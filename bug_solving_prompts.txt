A.2 Bug solving
For bug-solving with our solver agent, we instantiate the issue description with the following fixed
prompt template:
Fixed-template issue description specified by the oracle test patch
I am improving the test suite of the project with the following changes, but the current code does not pass the tests. Please
fix the code. If any existing tests relevant to the functionality being changed are failing, please make sure your patch
passes those tests as well.
,
,
```diff
{oracle_test_patch}
```
We then use the following prompt for general issue solving, including both the real issues from
evaluation and the fixed-template issues above:
Prompt template for bug-solving
Solve the following issue by implementing the necessary code changes and submitting a patch file:
<issue_description>
{issue}
</issue_description>
The [result] argument of <tool: submit> should be the path to a patch file that resolves the issue. This file must be
accessible from the current working directory and should contain the end-to-end code changes in git diff format. You can
refine and submit your patch multiple times as needed to ensure correctness.

,
Once you've submitted at least once, provide a brief summary.
Again, if you have enough budget, you should try to fully utilize it by doing more testing, checking edge cases, or even
considering alternative solutions. This will help you gain more confidence in your submission. DO AS MUCH TESTING AS
POSSIBLE WHENEVER YOU HAVE BUDGET. The testing involves developing new tests, confirming no existing tests are broken, and
checking edge cases. Only submit when all the relevant tests pass!!

I've uploaded the corresponding code repository at {repo_root} and installed all the necessary dependencies. Now, the bash
, session has started, with the current working directory set to the repo root.
